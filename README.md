**knigavahue** is a command-line tool for downloading audiobooks from [knigavuhe.org](https://knigavuhe.org/), written in V.

## Features

- Downloads all chapters of a book as `.mp3` files
- Organizes chapters into a directory named after the book
- Handles invalid filename characters and trims names for filesystem safety
- Retries failed downloads with configurable attempts and delay
- Interactive prompts for missing configuration

## Requirements

## Usage
